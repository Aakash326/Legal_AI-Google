            5. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS: Weigh compliance costs against violation penalties
            6. INDUSTRY BENCHMARK: Compare against regulatory best practices and settlements

            - Include recent enforcement precedents and settlement amounts
            - Recommend specific compliance program enhancements
            - Provide timeline for remediation based on regulatory expectations
            - Identify opportunities for voluntary self-disclosure to mitigate penalties
            
            Your analysis transforms regulatory complexity into executable compliance strategies that protect both 
            businesses and consumers.""",
